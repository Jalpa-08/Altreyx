# 🔍 Introduction
This repository contains workflows developed using Alteryx Designer, aimed at automating, analyzing, and visualizing data workflows efficiently with little to no code. Alteryx is a leading self-service data analytics platform that enables users to connect to data sources, cleanse and transform data, perform advanced analytics, and output insights—all in a drag-and-drop interface.

The project demonstrates key capabilities of Alteryx such as:

Data Input & Output: Seamless integration with Excel, CSV, SQL databases, and cloud sources.

Data Preparation: Filtering, joining, parsing, and cleaning raw datasets using built-in tools.

Transformation & Automation: Scheduling workflows, using conditional logic, and chaining multiple tasks.

Analytical Workflows: Performing calculations, aggregations, and visual data profiling.

Reporting: Generating formatted reports and dashboards for stakeholders.
